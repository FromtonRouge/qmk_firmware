The Kaladrius is an orthographic steno keyboard inspired by the [Jackdaw steno theory](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/jackdaw)
The main goal is to be able to code with a chorded keyboard. It's still a prototype and hope to use it daily this year (2019) at work.
It's a handwired and printable keyboard and use a Teensy++ 2.0
