# Kaladrius Steno Keyboard

The Kaladrius is an orthographic steno keyboard inspired by the [Jackdaw steno theory](https://sites.google.com/site/ploverdoc/jackdaw)
The main goal is to be able to code with a chorded keyboard. It's still a prototype and hope to use it daily this year (2019) at work.
It's a handwired and printable keyboard.

At the moment there are 2 versions of the Kaladrius
- The standard version based on a teensy 3.2 (not functional yet). More information [here](standard/readme.md)
  This version is easy to build.
- The splitted version based on a teensy++ 2.0 and a mcp23018 (functional). More information [here](splitted/readme.md)
  This version is harder to build (more electronic components) and because of the mcp23018 is also slower than the standard version.
